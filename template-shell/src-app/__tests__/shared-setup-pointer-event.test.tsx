//
// Contract test for the `PointerEvent` shim installed by the shared
// `vitest.setup.ts`, which every jsdom suite in this template and in every
// scaffolded project loads: the host app, each MFE package through
// `src-app/vitest.mfe.base.ts`, and every workspace package through
// `definePackageVitestConfig`. A package config that hand-rolls its own object
// instead of calling that helper drops out of this guarantee without saying so,
// which is why the helper takes `plugins` and `alias` rather than leaving a
// package to reach for `defineConfig` when it needs them.
//
// The suite lives here rather than beside the setup file because the template
// root Vitest project runs under `node`, where there is no DOM to shim and
// nothing to prove.
//
// Without the shim, jsdom exposes no `PointerEvent` constructor and the first
// component that constructs one off its owner window, the way Base UI's
// checkbox, radio and switch roots forward a click onto their hidden native
// input, dies with `TypeError: ownerWindow(...).PointerEvent is not a
// constructor` before rendering anything.
