/**
 * MFE Registry Composition Root
 *
 * The now-deleted screensets assembly package used to own this singleton
 * (its old `mfe/runtime/index.ts`) as a "backward compatibility" re-export
 * shim over `@gears-frontx/mfes`. That package has been deleted with no
 * surviving shim (Stage 2b) — the singleton wiring is app-layer
 * composition, so it now lives here, in the template's framework package,
 * rather than in a core SDK package.
 *
 * This is the primary way application code obtains a MfeRegistry instance:
 * the factory accepts configuration (including a TypeSystemPlugin) and
 * returns the registry singleton. After the first `build()`, subsequent
 * calls return the cached instance.
 *
