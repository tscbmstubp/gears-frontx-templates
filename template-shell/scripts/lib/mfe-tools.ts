 * re-printing a captured copy would only duplicate it.
 *
 * What is missing there is a next step. The federation plugin reports a failed
 * type generation as a bare `TYPE-001` code: it says the DTS build gave up but
 * not which declaration provoked it, because the plugin swallows the tsc
 * diagnostics behind its own code. That leaves the exit code as the only other
 * signal, and recovering the real one-line type error means knowing that each
 * MFE package carries its own `type-check` script, so the hint names that exact
 * command rather than describing it.
 *
 * A spawn failure gets the opposite treatment: nothing ran, so there is no
 * output above to interpret and no type error to chase. It carries the
 * underlying reason instead, because a bare `spawn ... ENOENT` does not say
 * which of the two commands could not be found or that an MFE build is what
 * failed.
 *
 * A signal kill is reported the same way, and for the same reason. Node reports
 * it as a null exit code with the signal alongside, so pairing it with the
 * TYPE-001 hint sent the reader looking for a type error in a build that was
 * stopped from outside - and "exit code null" named nothing at all. The two
 * likely causes are worth stating, since neither is a compile failure.
