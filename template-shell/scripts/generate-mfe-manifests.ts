/**
 * MFE Manifest Generation Script
 *
 * Reads the enriched mfe-manifest.json (produced by the frontx-mf-gts Vite
 * plugin into each MFE's dist directory) and writes the aggregated manifest
 * to a public asset (`public/generated-mfe-manifests.json`) served by Vite at
 * the runtime URL `/generated-mfe-manifests.json`. Every FrontX app instance
 * (root host AND any nested app) reads it from that URL at runtime.
 *
 * The enriched mfe-manifest.json already contains all required data:
 * - manifest.metaData: publicPath, remoteEntry, buildInfo from mf-manifest.json
 * - manifest.shared[]: standalone ESM deps with resolved versions and chunkPaths
 * - entries[].exposeAssets: from mf-manifest.json exposes[]
 *
 * Pipeline per MFE package:
 *   1. Read dist/mfe-manifest.json — enriched by the build plugin
 *   2. Refuse the run when any identifier in it is not a parseable GTS id, so a
 *      typo fails the build instead of the host's bootstrap
 *   3. Inject resolved publicPath (overrides build-time placeholder)
 *   4. Copy shared dep `chunkPath` entries unchanged from the enriched manifest
 *   5. Map entries to MfeEntryMF shape with the resolved MfManifest object
 *      inlined into each entry's `manifest` field (the schema accepts both
 *      string ID and inline object; inline removes the need for any consumer
 *      to spread/override the entry to attach the manifest reference at
 *      registration time, so consumers can pass entries opaquely to
 *      `typeSystem.register()`)
 *
 * A package whose `mfe.json` declares `"templateExample": true` is left out of
 * the aggregate entirely: it is content the template ships to be read and
 * copied, and an applied project that registered it would offer screens its
 * developer never asked for. `FRONTX_INCLUDE_TEMPLATE_EXAMPLES=1` puts them
 * back, for a run that means to watch the shipped examples rather than read
 * them.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/generate-mfe-manifests.ts [--base-url <url>]
 *
 * When --base-url is omitted, publicPath comes from manifest.metaData.publicPath
 * in the enriched mfe-manifest.json (set by the build plugin from mf-manifest.json).
