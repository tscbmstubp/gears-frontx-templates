/**
 * FrontX Template Dependency Cruiser Configuration (template-shell/, self-contained)
 *
 * Template-internal layering/isolation rules, relocated here from the
 * ecosystem monorepo root by Phase 11 template-move: MFE vertical-slice
 * isolation, screenset flux architecture, app/package boundary, and the
 * state/i18n -> framework -> react layer purity chain — all fully contained
 * within this directory. See the ecosystem root's `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`
 * for the rules that still apply to `mfes`, `gts-plugin`, `api`, `cli`,
 * `screensets`.
 *
 * This is the template's only dependency-cruiser config. The former
 * `template-shell/internal/depcruise-config/` copy and the four per-package
 * `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` files it served are deleted: the
 * `arch:deps:sdk|framework|react` scripts that loaded them are gone, which left
 * them as present-but-dead guard config. The two rules that had no survivor
 * here — error-severity `no-circular` and `sdk-no-gears-frontx-imports` — are
 * restored below rather than dropped.

/**
 * A cross-package import inside this tree reaches dependency-cruiser under two
 * different shapes, and a `to` rule covering only one of them never fires:
 *
 * 1. Resolved: with `node_modules` installed, `preserveSymlinks` is false, so
 *    `@gears-frontx/state` resolves through the workspace symlink and then
 *    through the package's `exports`/`main` — which every package here points at
 *    `./dist/...`. The resolved path is therefore `packages/state/dist/index.js`,
 *    NOT `packages/state/src/...`, which is why `dist` must stay in the graph
 *    (see `doNotFollow` below, not `exclude`).
 * 2. Unresolvable: with `node_modules` absent — the normal state of this tree,
 *    which is consumed as a template rather than installed — `resolved` falls
 *    back to the bare specifier `@gears-frontx/state`.
 *
 * `pkgTargets` covers both, derived from the package directory names, so the
 * layer chain holds in an installed tree and in a bare one.
