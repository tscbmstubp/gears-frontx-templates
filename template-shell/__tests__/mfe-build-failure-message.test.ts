/**
 * Tests for the report a failed MFE build rejects with.
 *
 * The failure this covers is a dead end rather than a wrong answer. The Module
 * Federation plugin prints `TYPE-001` for a failed type generation and keeps the
 * tsc diagnostics to itself, so the operator is left with a code, an exit status
 * and no next step.
 *
 * `build-mfes.ts` and `dev-all.ts` both print this message as-is, which is what
 * makes it worth pinning: the message is the whole failure report, so the cases
 * here assert it still carries a route onward rather than assert its wording.
