/**
 * Version-Bump-On-Change CI Gate (#575, follow-up from #574 review).
 *
 * MOVED to the templates-only repo along with `template-shell` and
 * `template-mfe`. This is the TEMPLATE half of the original gate; the
 * `packages/*` half stayed behind in `gears-frontx` as its own script. There
 * is no `packages/*` directory in this repo at all, so `readEcosystemPackages`
 * below always returns `[]` here - the governed-root discovery this file
 * still shares with the ecosystem repo's copy degrades gracefully to "every
 * directory a template contributes" rather than needing a separate code path.
 *
 * #574 changed `@gears-frontx/react`'s public API and shipped with no version
 * bump, and nothing caught it. The two existing `policy:*` guards could not
 * have caught it either, because both are CONSISTENCY checks, not CHANGE
 * checks: `policy:version-check` validates the ecosystem packages' semver
 * lines and the mfes->gts-plugin coupling edge in isolation, and
 * `policy:template-pin-drift` verifies a pinned dependency range matches
 * whatever version is on disk RIGHT NOW. A PR that edits `src/` and bumps
 * nothing passes both: the pins still "match" the stale version, and the
 * semver line is still internally consistent - just unchanged.
 *
 * This guard asks the one question neither of those does: did a package with
 * substantive changes in this PR ALSO change its own `version`? It diffs the
 * PR branch against the merge base with its target branch, groups the changed
 * files by owning package directory, and fails for any package whose
 * substantive changes were not accompanied by a version bump.
 *
 * ## Which directories are "a package" here
 *
 * A governed package is any non-`private` package whose own name is in the
 * ecosystem's npm scope (`@gears-frontx/*`), discovered by REUSING
 * `template-ecosystem-packages.mjs`'s existing structural discovery
 * (`readEcosystemPackages` for `packages/*`, `readTemplateEcosystemPackages`
 * for every template's own root identity AND every one of its workspace
 * members - see that module's docblock for why re-deriving either walk here
 * would be the duplicated-knowledge bug its own predecessor was rewritten to
 * remove) rather than a second, narrower copy of it. Concretely, today:
 *
 *  - every `packages/*` directory (this repo's own published ecosystem
 *    artifacts);
 *  - `template-shell` ITSELF (`@gears-frontx/frontx-template-shell`) - it
 *    publishes `dist-lib`, built from its own `src/`, and is exact-pinned by
 *    four `template-mfe` fixture manifests, exactly the #574 shape this gate
 *    exists for;
 *  - every `template-shell/packages/*` workspace member (react, auth,
 *    framework, i18n, state, studio - ADR-0033 relocated `@gears-frontx/react`'s
 *    source there, and #574 is the concrete case that skipped a bump).
 *
 * `template-mfe` and its four `src-app/mfe_packages/*` fixture apps
 * (`@gears-frontx/demo-mfe` and friends) ARE in the ecosystem's npm scope -
 * scope alone does not exclude them - but every one of them declares
 * `private: true`, and it is exactly that per-package fact, not a heuristic
 * on `template-mfe`'s own (unscoped) root manifest, that excludes them here:
 * they pin these packages' PUBLISHED versions rather than being one of them,
 * and are covered once the source package bumps by
 * `policy:template-pin-drift`, not by this gate. The same `private: true`
 * check is what would exempt a future `template-shell/src-app/mfe_packages/*`
 * member too, should that workspace pattern ever gain one.
 *
 * A MANIFEST-ONLY template - a top-level template dir with
 * `frontx-template.json` but no `package.json` at all - is governed too,
 * discovered separately by `discoverManifestOnlyTemplateRoots`: nothing
 * installable lives there, so the manifest's own `version` field is the
 * version this gate compares, and the substantive rule is
 * `hasSubstantiveTemplateChange` (the whole tree, not a `src/` convention).
 * "Manifest-only" describes a ROOT (no package.json, only the template
 * manifest); it is unrelated to "docs-only", which describes a FILE that
 * `isDocsOnlyPath` exempts (`*.md`, `llms.txt`). Whether a root is
 * manifest-only is decided by whether it had a `package.json` AT THE MERGE
 * BASE, not at HEAD: a PR that both adds a `package.json` to such a template
 * and changes its content must not thereby talk its way out of the manifest
 * bump the base classification demands.
 *
 * ## What counts as a substantive change
 *
 * Per file, relative to its package root:
 *  - anything under `src/` (excluding a pure-docs file - `*.md` or
 *    `llms.txt` - even one that happens to live inside `src/`);
 *  - `package.json` ITSELF, but only when a dependency field
 *    (`dependencies`/`devDependencies`/`peerDependencies`/
 *    `optionalDependencies`) actually changed between the merge base and
 *    HEAD - not merely appearing in the diff (a version-only edit, a
 *    `scripts` tweak, must not itself force a second bump).
 *
 * Everything else - README changes, build config, a `package.json` edit that
 * touches no dependency field - is out of scope for this gate by
 * construction: it is simply never classified as substantive. This repo
 * colocates tests under `src/` (e.g. `src/tokens.test.ts`), so the issue's
 * open question about test-only changes resolves to "still substantive"
 * here: a change to only `packages/ui-kit/src/tokens.test.ts` DOES force a
 * bump, same as any other `src/` file - deliberately, since `src/` is the
 * one signal this gate trusts, not a second classification of what's
 * "inside" it.
 *
 * ## Why the comparison is merge-base-to-HEAD content, not "did the diff touch
 * version"
 *
 * `versionAt(ref, packageRoot)` reads the actual `package.json` blob at a ref
 * and pulls `version` out of it - it does not inspect the diff hunk. That is
 * what makes a bump-then-revert within one PR still fail: if `version` is
 * edited in an early commit and reverted in a later one, `git diff --name-only`
 * may not even list `package.json` as changed at the merge base once the
 * revert lands, and the two blobs compared here are IDENTICAL - so if `src/`
 * also changed in that PR (a separate file), the substantive check still
 * trips and the version comparison still correctly reports "unchanged".
 * Comparing anything other than the two endpoints' actual content would miss
 * that case.
 *
 * A package with no `package.json` at the merge base (introduced by this PR)
 * is skipped rather than failed: a brand-new package has no prior version to
 * have bumped FROM. Likewise a package whose `package.json` no longer exists
 * at HEAD (removed by this PR) is skipped - there is no version left to check.
 * The same two skips apply to a manifest-only template root, with
 * `frontx-template.json` in the role of the manifest that must exist at the
 * ref. A manifest that EXISTS at a ref but declares no usable `version` is
 * a different situation entirely and is never a silent skip - `versionAt`
 * fails loudly instead.
 *
 * CLI entry: `node scripts/version-bump-on-change-check.mjs [--base-ref <ref>]`
 * (exit 0 on success). `--base-ref` defaults to `VERSION_BUMP_BASE_REF`, then
 * `origin/${GITHUB_BASE_REF}` (set by GitHub Actions on `pull_request`
 * events), then `origin/develop`. Core logic is exported for unit tests in
 * `scripts/version-bump-on-change-check.test.mjs`.
