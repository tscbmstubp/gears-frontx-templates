/**
 * What this repo's FrontX ecosystem IS, and which of its packages a template
 * pins - both DERIVED from manifests on disk, never declared.
 *
 * The predecessor of this module declared them: `['api', 'mfes', 'gts-plugin']`,
 * one constant shared by the pin-drift CI guard and the dev-link script so the
 * two could not disagree. Sharing was right; the array was the bug. #496 added
 * `packages/telemetry` while #493 was in review, and nothing in either tool
 * noticed: a template pinning `@gears-frontx/telemetry` at a stale version was
 * silently unchecked by the guard and silently left unlinked by the dev loop. A
 * list a human must remember to edit is exactly the duplicated knowledge these
 * tools exist to prevent, so there is no package array here at all.
 *
 * ## The ecosystem truth map
 *
 * Every `packages/*` manifest contributes `name -> version`. Not a curated
 * subset: `cli` and `cyber-pilot-kit-frontx` are never installed by a seeded
 * project, but including them costs nothing (no template pins them) and makes a
 * pin on them verifiable rather than unverifiable. A `packages/*` directory with
 * NO manifest is skipped - a stray directory or a cleaned build output is not a
 * package. A manifest that IS there but cannot be read, cannot be parsed, or
 * declares no `name`/`version` FAILS CLOSED naming the file: an unusable
 * manifest must never read as "this package has no version to compare against",
 * which is indistinguishable from "none of its pin sites drifted".
 *
 * `packages/*` is not the whole truth, though (#501): a template can pin
 * ANOTHER template's own identity or one of that template's workspace members
 * - `template-mfe` pins `@gears-frontx/frontx-template-shell` and every one of
 * `template-shell/packages/*` (react, auth, framework, i18n, state) to exact
 * versions, and none of those names live under this repo's own `packages/*`.
 * `readTemplateEcosystemPackages` asks each template the same question
 * `packages/*` already answers - what do you publish, and at what version -
 * and `readEcosystemTruthVersions` folds the answer in on top. Its own
 * docblock covers the scope gate and the fail-closed rule on a missing
 * version; `packages/*` is folded in first and never overwritten by a
 * template's contribution of the same name (see `readEcosystemTruthVersions`
 * for why that tie-break is the right one).
 *
 * ## A pin on a name the truth map does not have
 *
 * FAILS LOUDLY, naming the site - a pin this repo cannot verify is not a pin
 * this repo may assume correct. Deleting `packages/api/package.json` is what
 * makes that rule load-bearing: `@gears-frontx/api` drops out of the truth map,
 * and without this rule every pin on it would quietly stop being compared
 * (`findDriftedSites` cannot distinguish "no truth entry" from "matches"). With
 * it, the missing manifest surfaces at the pin sites that depend on it.
 *
 * The remaining exception is a name the scanned tree DEFINES itself, which npm
 * resolves locally through a workspace whatever range it carries, so no
 * registry version exists for it to drift from. That exception is not a
 * courtesy: `template-shell` is a workspace root (`workspaces: ["packages/*",
 * ...]`) whose members are `@gears-frontx/auth`, `@gears-frontx/state` and
 * friends - names in the ecosystem's own npm scope that this repo's `packages/`
 * deliberately does not publish. The monorepo's own manifests get the same
 * treatment against the names its root `workspaces` declare, which is why
 * `internal/*` (`@gears-frontx/eslint-config`, `@gears-frontx/depcruise-config`)
 * needs no special case despite being outside the truth map. In practice this
 * exception now mostly matters for a template pinning its OWN workspace
 * member (`template-shell` pinning its own `@gears-frontx/auth`, say): the
 * truth map above already carries that name at that template's real version,
 * so the exception and the truth map agree; it stays load-bearing for a name
 * defined in a tree the truth map has no reason to walk (an `internal/*`
 * workspace, for one).
 *
 * The npm scope itself is derived from the truth map's own names, so not even
 * the string `@gears-frontx` is written down here.
 *
 * Consumers: `template-pin-drift-check.mjs` (compares every pin site against
 * the truth map); `link-template-ecosystem.mjs` (repoints exactly the
 * `packages/*` directories the template pins at their local builds - template
 * contributions never enter that linker, since a template's own workspace
 * member already resolves locally with nothing published to shadow it);
 * `version-bump-on-change-check.mjs` (reuses `readTemplateEcosystemPackages`
 * directly, on top of the same `packages/*` walk, to enumerate the package
 * ROOTS its CI gate governs - narrowed further there to the non-`private`
 * ones, since a template's own scope-qualified fixture apps are pinned
 * consumers rather than publishable sources); and the install-time pin
 * rewriter `pin-template-ecosystem-to-local.mjs`, which substitutes a local
 * directory for a pin the registry cannot serve.
 *
 * The ecosystem repo's companion rewriter, `pin-unpublished-ecosystem-to-
 * local-pack.mjs` (substituting a local `npm pack` tarball instead of a
 * directory, for a job that needed the published ARTIFACT rather than the
 * working tree), did NOT come along with the templates - it existed to
 * validate an in-monorepo composition step this repo no longer has any
 * in-repo unpublished ecosystem source to run against. It stayed in
 * `gears-frontx`.

 * npm registry: the pinned version must actually exist for a scoped
 * ecosystem package. There is no "current version" to compare against here,
 * only "does this published version exist", which is why this mode returns
 * a verifier function rather than a name->version map.

/**
 * Reads one already-parsed manifest as an ecosystem truth-map candidate, or
 * says why it is not one - the one rule shared by a template's own identity
 * and each of its workspace members (see `readTemplateEcosystemPackages`).
 *
 * A missing or non-ecosystem-scope `name` returns `null`: it declares no
 * identity this map governs, so there is nothing to compare and nothing to
 * fail closed on either - the same judgment `readEcosystemPackages` makes for
 * a `packages/*` directory with no manifest at all, applied here to a name
 * outside scope instead of a missing file. This is what lets
 * `template-mfe/package.json` (`frontx-template-mfe-monorepo-harness`,
 * unscoped, `private: true`, deliberately carrying no version - see that
 * file's own leading comment) sit right next to `template-shell/package.json`
 * (`@gears-frontx/frontx-template-shell`) without either needing a special
 * case: one is in scope and the other isn't, and only that decides.
 *
 * Once a name IS in scope, though, it is unconditionally a truth candidate,
 * so a missing `version` fails closed exactly as an unusable `packages/*`
 * manifest does - "no version" must never be indistinguishable from "matches".
 *
 * @param {Record<string, unknown>} manifest
 * @param {string} manifestPath reported in the fail-closed error
 * @param {(name: string) => boolean} isEcosystemScopeName
 * @returns {{ name: string; version: string } | null}

/**
 * Every `{ dir, name, version }` a template's OWN tree contributes to the

 * manifest (its published identity, e.g. `@gears-frontx/frontx-template-shell`)
 * and every workspace member its root `workspaces` patterns select (e.g.
 * `template-shell/packages/auth`).
 *
 * WHY templates need asking at all (#501): `template-mfe` pins subpackages of
 * `template-shell` (its own workspace members) and `template-shell` itself,
 * and none of those names live under this repo's `packages/*` - so without
 * this, every one of those pins is structurally unverifiable, not merely
 * unpinned coincidence. This closes that gap the same way `packages/*` is
 * built: derived from manifests on disk, never declared.
 *
 * This deliberately does NOT restrict which `workspaces` pattern counts - not
 * `packages/*` specifically, whatever the template's own root manifest
 * declares - for the same reason `readRepoDefinedPackageNames` does not
 * special-case `packages/*` for the monorepo root: a template's workspace
 * layout is exactly as free to change as the monorepo's own, and a governed
 * subset would be the hand-maintained list this file's whole design exists to
 * avoid. In practice this also picks up `template-mfe`'s own MFE fixture
 * packages (`@gears-frontx/demo-mfe` and friends) as truth entries; harmless,
 * since nothing pins an exact version of a leaf MFE app.
 *
 * Every candidate is filtered through `ecosystemScopedNameVersion`, so a
 * template or workspace member outside the ecosystem's own npm scope (or with
 * no manifest, or no `name`) contributes nothing, while one that IS in scope
 * fails closed on a missing `version` rather than silently dropping out.
