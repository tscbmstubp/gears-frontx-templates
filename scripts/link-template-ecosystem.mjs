/**
 * In-monorepo dev loop for the shell template.
 *
 * `template-shell/` is not a root workspace: it is a standalone npm project
 * that pins the FrontX ecosystem packages it consumes to exact registry
 * versions so a seeded project can install outside the monorepo. The cost of
 * that pin is that a plain `npm install` inside the template resolves the
 * *published* alpha, so edits to `packages/*` never reach the template and the
 * failure is silent - the template builds, type-checks and tests green against
 * code nobody changed.
 *
 * WHICH packages those are is asked of the template, not declared here: the set
 * is every `packages/*` directory the template pins at an exact registry
 * version (`templatePinnedPackageDirs`). That is the honest question, because a
 * published tarball is the only thing a link can shadow - a dependency the
 * template already reaches through `file:` or a workspace resolves locally and
 * needs no link. A hand-written array was the predecessor of that derivation and
 * it went stale exactly as expected: `packages/telemetry` (#496) would have been
 * left unlinked with nothing reporting it.
 *
 * This script repoints those installed ecosystem directories at the local
 * `packages/*` builds. What it links is the whole package directory, but what a
 * consumer then resolves through it is `dist/` - which is why an unbuilt package
 * is refused instead of linked. It replaces exactly those entries and touches
 * nothing else: not `package.json`, not `package-lock.json`, not the rest of the
 * tree.
 *
 * A `npm install --no-save --no-package-lock <paths>` would do the linking too,
 * but npm rebuilds the whole ideal tree for it — pruning unrelated packages and
 * replacing the template's `file:.` self-link with a packed snapshot of
 * `dist-lib`, which breaks the template's own rebuild-on-change loop.
 *
 * Run `npm ci` inside `template-shell` to go back to the pinned versions. There
 * is no `--unlink`: the links replace published tarball *content*, which only
 * npm can put back, so any inverse this script could offer would still end in
 * `npm ci` - after leaving a hole per linked package in the meantime.
 *
 * That same asymmetry is why a run that cannot create every link puts the tree
 * back rather than reporting how far it got: the installed content is moved
 * aside, never deleted, until the last symlink is in place. A failed link then
 * usually costs a re-run rather than an `npm ci` - and when the rollback itself
 * cannot put a directory back, the result says so and names it (`unrestored`),
 * because that is the one case `npm ci` is genuinely needed for.
 *
 * Core logic is exported for unit tests; only `runCli` touches the process.
 *
 * CLI entry: `npm run dev:template:link` (exit 0 on success).
