/**
 * CI-runtime-only fix for a `npm ci` that cannot possibly succeed on a feature
 * branch: `template-shell` pins the FrontX ecosystem packages it consumes
 * (`@gears-frontx/mfes`, `@gears-frontx/gts-plugin`, ...) to exact registry
 * versions, and `policy:version-bump-on-change` requires that pin to move the
 * moment a package's `src/` changes substantively. Publishing, though, is
 * gated to protected branches (`publish-packages.yml` runs only on
 * `main`/`develop`/`release/*`), so on any other branch the version the
 * template now names is one the registry does not carry yet. `npm ci` exits
 * `ETARGET` before the tree it installs even exists.
 *
 * That failure is spurious for `template-drift.yml` specifically: that job's
 * entire point is to discard whatever `npm ci` installs and repoint it at the
 * working tree (`dev:template:link`), so the unpublished version was never
 * going to be tested regardless. This script exists to get an installable
 * tree in front of that relink step in the one case where the registry
 * cannot supply one - by rewriting the template's OWN pins to `file:` paths
 * into `packages/*` before `npm install` ever runs, in the runner's checkout
 * only. The workflow restores the committed manifests with `git checkout`
 * immediately afterward, so no build or type-check step ever sees a rewritten
 * manifest.
 *
 * WHICH pins get rewritten is derived, never declared: `scanTreePins` (the
 * same helper `dev:template:link` and the pin-drift guard use) finds every
 * exact-registry-version pin site in the template's tree, and this script
 * substitutes exactly the ones naming a package this repo actually builds
 * under `packages/*` (`readEcosystemPackages`). A pin this repo does not
 * build - a foreign scope, a template-internal workspace member - is left
 * completely untouched.
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT do: it never resolves an `@gears-frontx`
 * ecosystem name from the registry, and it never relaxes a pin onto some
 * OTHER registry version - the substitution always points at this checkout's
 * own `packages/*`. Every other way an install can fail (an unresolvable
 * third-party dependency, a peer conflict, a corrupt lockfile edge) still
 * fails exactly as before it. Whether the PUBLISHED pins install at all is a
 * different question, answered by `Template Validate` (`main.yml`), which this
 * script does not touch.
 *
 * The ecosystem repo this script came from paired it with a second rewriter,
 * `pin-unpublished-ecosystem-to-local-pack.mjs`, for a `main.yml` composition
 * step that needed a published-shaped ARTIFACT (an `npm pack` tarball) rather
 * than this checkout's working tree - covering the case where a bumped
 * ecosystem pin had not been published yet. That step does not exist here:
 * this repo has no in-repo unpublished ecosystem source to substitute for, so
 * the tarball rewriter did not come along with the templates and stayed in
 * `gears-frontx`.
 *
 * Core logic is exported for unit tests; only `runCli` touches the process.
 *
 * CLI entry: `node scripts/pin-template-ecosystem-to-local.mjs` (exit 0 on
 * success, non-zero if there is nothing to substitute or an `overrides`
 * conflict is found).

 * rather than `DEPENDENCY_FIELDS` minus one name: a peer range declares the
 * semver window a CONSUMER must independently satisfy, not an edge npm resolves
 * here, so `file:../packages/mfes` in that field is not a localized pin - it is
 * an unsatisfiable compatibility claim shipped into the template's manifest.
 * A field added to `DEPENDENCY_FIELDS` later stays excluded until someone
 * decides it is installable, which is the safe default for a writer.
 *
 * `DEPENDENCY_FIELDS` itself stays whole: `template-pin-drift-check.mjs` must
 * keep reporting a stale exact peer pin (a real drift), and `version-bump-on-
 * change-check.mjs` must keep counting a peer edit as substantive - see
 * `template-ecosystem-packages.mjs`'s own docblock for what DEPENDENCY_FIELDS
 * mirrors and why.
 *
 * Only a WRITER of `file:` specifiers has the narrower question, which is why
 * the narrower list lives here rather than being folded into
 * `DEPENDENCY_FIELDS`. It is exported for its own unit tests; the ecosystem
 * repo's companion writer that once imported it here,
 * `pin-unpublished-ecosystem-to-local-pack.mjs`, did not come along with the
 * templates (see this file's own docblock). `template-lockfile-selflink-
 * check.mjs` keeps its own same-valued list on purpose regardless: it READS an
 * install tree and asks which fields materialise an entry there, a different
 * question that happens to have the same answer today.

 *    would silently discard whatever that entry was protecting; this stops
 *    and names both values instead.
